        <h2>Death from laughter</h2>
        <p>
            Death from laughter is a supposedly extremely rare form of death, usually resulting from either cardiac
            arrest or asphyxiation, that has itself been caused by a fit of laughter. Instances of death by laughter
            have been recorded from the times of ancient Greece to modern times.

            Usually, the phrase "dying from laughter" is used as hyperbole.
        </p>       


        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
    Death may result from several pathologies that deviate from benign laughter. Infarction of the pons and the medulla oblongata in the brain may cause the pseudobulbar affect.[2] Asphyxiation caused by laughter leads the body to shut down from the lack of oxygen.

    Laughter can cause atonia and collapse ("agelastic syncope"), which in turn can cause trauma. See also laughter-induced syncope, cataplexy, and Bezold-Jarisch reflex. Gelastic seizures can be due to focal lesions to the hypothalamus.[7] Depending upon the size of the lesion, the emotional lability may be a sign of an acute condition, and not itself the cause of the fatality. Gelastic syncope has also been associated with the cerebellum.

                    <li>In 1410, King Martin of Aragon died from a combination of indigestion and uncontrollable laughter triggered by a joke told by his favourite court jester.[11]</li>
                    <li>In 1556, Pietro Aretino "is said to have died of suffocation from laughing too much".[12]</li>
                    <li>In 1660, Thomas Urquhart, the Scottish aristocrat, polymath, and first translator of François Rabelais's writings into English, is said to have died laughing upon hearing that Charles II had taken the throne.[13][14]</li>
                    <li>On October 14, 1920, 56-year-old Arthur Cobcroft, a dog trainer from Loftus Street, Leichhardt, Australia, was reading a five-year-old newspaper and was amused at the prices for some commodities in 1915 as compared to 1920. He made a remark to his wife regarding this, and burst into laughter, and in the midst of it he collapsed and died. A doctor named Doctor Nixon was called in, and stated that the death was due to heart failure, brought by excessive laughter.[15][16][17][18]</li>
                    <li>On March 24, 1975, Alex Mitchell, from King's Lynn, England, died laughing while watching the "Kung Fu Kapers" episode of The Goodies, featuring a kilt-clad Scotsman with his bagpipes battling a master of the Lancastrian martial art "Eckythump", who was armed with a black pudding. After 25 minutes of continuous laughter, Mitchell then slumped on the sofa and died from heart failure. His widow later sent The Goodies a letter thanking them for making Mitchell's final moments of life so pleasant.[19][20][21][22] Diagnosis of his granddaughter in 2012 of having the inheritable long QT syndrome (a heart rhythm abnormality) suggests that Mitchell may have died of a cardiac arrest caused by the same condition.[23]</li>
                    <li>In 1989, during the initial run of the film A Fish Called Wanda, a 56-year-old Danish audiologist named Ole Bentzen reportedly laughed himself to death.[24][25]</li>
